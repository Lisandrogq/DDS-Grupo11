## PokeAPI

our client has asked us to build a program to: - get a pokemon basic stats: name, image, moves - get pokemons that have a certain move

### How to run it

The program must be built from the source(this code):

1. **clone**: `git clone `
2. **cd into this folder**: `cd assignments/pokemon`
3. **install dependencies**: `yarn` or `npm install`
4. **build**: `yarn run build` or `npm run build`
5. **run it!**: `yarn start` or `npm start`

Btw, you need to have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.
