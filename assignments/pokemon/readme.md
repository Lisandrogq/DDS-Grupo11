## PokeAPI

Our client has asked us to build a program to: 
- get a pokemon basic stats: name, image, moves
- get pokemons that have a certain move

### How to run it

The program must be built from source:

1. **clone**: `git clone https://github.com/Lisandrogq/DDS-Grupo11.git`
2. **cd into this folder**: `cd assignments/pokemon`
3. **install dependencies**: `yarn` or `npm install`
4. **build**: `yarn run build` or `npm run build`
5. **run it!**: `yarn start` or `npm start`

Btw, you need to have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.
