## Anual

### Entrega 3 due date: 26/07

-   [ ] Refactor code for contributors, technicians, etc inheritance
-   [ ] Colabs cards: mail delivery, register actions, keep track of usage(actions), validate time window for executing actions
-   [ ] Incidents: alerts and technic failure. Mark fridge as inactive, register failure and send mail to the nearest technician. Technician visits should be registered as well.
-   [ ] Events subscriptions: allow collaborators to subscribe to certain events and notify them.
-   [ ] Reports: run a weekly function to collect reports.
-   [ ] Design justifications.
-   [ ] Diagrams: class diagram, use case and sequency.
-   [ ] Tests

We probably won't be able to finish it all by the due date. We should at least try to get all the basic features done and leave the rest for the next correction date. That, I estimate, would, among other things, include:

-   [ ] The code refactor for the contributors, technicians, etc (we can be sure to pospone this since it won't change the internal calls and the overall management of the code, other than the managers, which are actually easy to change).
-   [ ] Testing
